----------------------------

he number of HTTP methods you'll use is quite smallâ€”there are just four HTTP "verbs" you'll need to know! They are:

GET: retrieves information from the specified source (you just saw this one!)
POST: sends new information to the specified source.
PUT: updates existing information of the specified source.
DELETE: removes existing information from the specified source.

in a succesful request you get a response, like 200, but there are more and here is a list:
